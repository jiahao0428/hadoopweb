A significant number of studies on the topic of origin
destination (OD) matrices for traffic networks have been
performed in the past. While some have formulated a unified
framework for estimating or updating OD matrices based on
traffic counts for a road network [4], others have focused on
doing the same for congested road networks [5]. The topic
of inferring passenger travel patterns from smart card data
of rail networks in urban regions has also been studied in
some detail in the past. One particular example is the case
study in Shenzhen, China, in which Liu et al. [6] analyzed
individual and collective passenger mobility patterns. However,
their analysis relied heavily on empirical observations and
could not make a strong distinction between common and
individual spatial or temporal patterns. Li et al. [7] introduced
the idea of clustering nearby stations and proposed models
for identifying morning, afternoon and evening peak patterns.
This study focused on using smart card data records resolved
in both space and time to study the collective spatial and
temporal mobility patterns. It also touched on studying travel
patterns at the individual passenger level and their regularity.
However, as in [6], Li et al. [7] did not make a clear distinction
between patterns that are ¡§common¡¨ and ¡§individual¡¨. In
some studies, clustering algorithms were applied to obtain
spatio-temporal patterns [8]. The focus, here, however, was
mainly on temporal patterns, and consequently spatial patterns
received little attention, which are of particular importance.
In conclusion, none of the above studies have shed light on
joint and individual spatial patterns across different days of
the week, or even different times of the day. We address this
issue, by developing common and individual low-dimensional
models for urban rail road networks by applying JIVE and
COBE on smart card data.
